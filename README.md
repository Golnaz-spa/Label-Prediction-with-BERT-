# BERT Model for Text Classification

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for text classification. The BERT model, developed by Google, has revolutionized the way natural language processing tasks are approached. This example focuses on classifying Stack Overflow questions into different categories based on their content.

## Project Setup

- **Library Installation**: The project requires the `transformers` library, which provides access to pre-trained BERT models and tokenizers.
- **Data Preparation**: An Excel file containing labeled Stack Overflow questions is used as the dataset. Preprocessing includes dropping unnecessary columns and converting categorical labels into numeric format.
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
- **Tokenization**: The BERT tokenizer converts text into tokens that can be processed by the model. This step involves specifying a maximum sequence length and padding shorter sequences.
- **Model Architecture**: A custom neural network architecture is defined, incorporating the pre-trained BERT model as the base. The network includes additional layers for dropout, ReLU activation, and softmax classification.
- **Training**: The model is trained on the pre-processed and tokenized training set using AdamW optimizer and a specified learning rate.
- **Evaluation**: The trained model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, and the best-performing model weights are saved.
- **Testing**: Finally, the model is tested on the unseen test set, and classification metrics are reported to assess its performance.

## Key Components

- **BERT Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes the 'bert-base-uncased' model suitable for text classification tasks.
- **Custom Neural Network**: Enhances the BERT model with additional fully connected layers to tailor it for the classification task.
- **Optimizer and Loss Function**: Employs the AdamW optimizer with class weights to handle imbalanced datasets and uses negative log-likelihood loss for classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates model performance using classification report metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Usage

1. **Environment Setup**: Install the `transformers` library using pip.
2. **Data Loading**: Load your dataset and perform necessary preprocessing steps.
3. **Model Training**: Customize the model's architecture, training epochs, and batch size as needed.
4. **Evaluation and Testing**: Use the provided functions to evaluate the model on validation and test datasets.

## Results Interpretation

The project concludes with an evaluation of the trained BERT model on a test dataset, reporting key classification metrics. By analyzing these metrics, one can assess the model's ability to accurately classify text into predefined categories, making adjustments to the training process as necessary for improved performance.
